description: "Talk Time x Orbseer CryptoMusicBox #01 Talk Time CryptoMusicBoxes are powered by the blockchain and collected from the finest curio shops in the metaverse. ----- Song: Dead Weight Album: Necessary Evil "my dear, how do we survive the teeth of this modern life? Musically this song takes some inspiration from one of our all time favorite tunes--Prince's 1999 opener "Let's Get Crazy". The track opens with Prince preaching carpe diem to a rapturous congregation, and to not let the devil ("elevator" was his metaphor for the Devil according to His greatness) take us down. "Dead Weight" is less carpe diem--and more let's learn to deal with the devils within us in order to prevent destruction and extinctions. “Let's Get Crazy” came out in 1982 and helped open a decade of excess and decadence, while "Dead Weight" is much more introspective, and is going to be released during a pandemic and social and economic unrest, and reflects the constant existential crises we're going through as individuals and as a species right now. ----- Each CryptoMusicBox comes with the following: • Augmented Reality Poster Print (first collector only) that activates a unique AR experience that brings the music box to life in their room while playing the featured song. • High Resolution mp4 file that loops to the full song • Printable 11x17 album art poster file • Holders of CryptoMusicBox NFTs will receive future airdrops of Talk Time NFTs, AR experiences, and token-gated access to Talk Time live shows/streams.

Oh you better we wise And you better know The fear when you close your eyes It’s easy It can wait it can wait until it’s too late S.O.S. and down we go No we never stay the same But we always have to play the game hey dead weight hey wait hey No we never stay the same But always make the same mistake Babe hates change Baby hates change I feel like we’re born to fight For pieces, a terrible lie We’re in paradise And it’s quite beautiful Go see the ghost Show him where it hurts Knowledge is cure And you’ll know it’s time to let go you can only be sure When you start My dear, why do we survive? To feel our love come to life Are we going to be fine? No we never stay the same But we always have to play the game hey dead weight hey wait hey No we never stay the same But always make the same mistake Babe hates change Baby hates change",
