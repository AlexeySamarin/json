The track opens with Prince preaching carpe diem to a rapturous congregation, and to not let the devil (\"elevator\" was his metaphor for the Devil according to His greatness) take us down. \"Dead Weight\" is less carpe diem--and more let's learn to deal with the devils within us in order to prevent destruction and extinctions. вЂњLet's Get CrazyвЂќ came out in 1982 and helped open a decade of excess and decadence, while \"Dead Weight\" is much more introspective, and is going to be released during a pandemic and social and economic unrest, and reflects the constant existential crises we're going through as individuals and as a species right now.\n\n-----\n\nEach CryptoMusicBox comes with the following:\n\nвЂў Augmented Reality Poster Print (first collector only) that activates a unique AR experience that brings the music box to life in their room while playing the featured song.\n\nвЂў High Resolution mp4 file that loops to the full song\n\nвЂў Printable 11x17 album art poster file\n\nвЂў Holders of CryptoMusicBox NFTs will receive future airdrops of Talk Time NFTs, AR experiences, and token-gated access to Talk Time live shows/streams.\n\nPersonnel:\n\nProduced by Math Bishop\nMastered by Dave Cooley\n\nVocals, Guitars, Bass: Edson Choi\nGuitars, Synths, Omnichord: Mike Nissen\n\nAdditional players:\nDrums: Andrew Smith\nKeys, Synths: Derek Howa\nSynths: Chucky Kim\n\ncopyright В©2021 Talk Time\n\nLyrics:\n\nMy dear, how do we survive\nThe teeth of this modern life?\nOh you better we wise\nAnd you better know\nThe fear\nwhen you close your eyes\nItвЂ™s easy\nIt can wait it can wait until itвЂ™s too late\nS.O.S. and down we go\n\nNo we never stay the same\nBut we always have to play the game hey dead weight\nhey wait hey\nNo we never stay the same\nBut always make the same mistake\nBabe hates change\nBaby hates change\n\nI feel like weвЂ™re born to fight\nFor pieces, a terrible lie\nWeвЂ™re in paradise\nAnd itвЂ™s quite beautiful\nGo see the ghost\nShow him where it hurts\nKnowledge is cure\nAnd youвЂ™ll know itвЂ™s time to let go you can only be sure\nWhen you start\n\nMy dear, why do we survive?\nTo feel our love come to life\nAre we going to be fine?\n\nNo we never stay the same\nBut we always have to play the game hey dead weight\nhey wait hey\nNo we never stay the same\nBut always make the same mistake\nBabe hates change\nBaby hates change","animation_url":"ipfs://ipfs/QmdvU4fQV12oNNc2DaYNcsS9Wjd2YCQme1UtD76NLq1ejn/animation.mp4","image":"ipfs://ipfs/QmdvU4fQV12oNNc2DaYNcsS9Wjd2YCQme1UtD76NLq1ejn/image.png","external_url":"https://rarible.com/token/0x751a5384ed5062231ffd04f31c7e287ce48e408b:1","attributes":[]},
